### Updating the GitHub Pages gem

Jekyll is an active open source project that is updated frequently. 
If the `github-pages` gem on your computer is out of date with 
the `github-pages` gem on the GitHub Pages server, 
your site may look different when built locally than when 
published on GitHub. To avoid this, 
regularly update the `github-pages` gem on your computer.

1. Open Git Bash.
2. Update the `github-pages` gem.
   * If you installed Bundler, run `bundle update github-pages`.
   * If you don't have Bundler installed, run `gem update github-pages`.
